htmlview
========

This project is a port of the Google "MiniJoe" CLDC / MIDP HTML renderer to Android.

If you need more HTML formatting than TextView, but a WebView is too much or too heavy (e.g. on a watch or wearable device), this might be useful for your project: HtmlView supports many HTML 4 features and a rich CSS 2.1 subset.

The HtmlViewDemo project illustrates how to use the HtmlView component.
